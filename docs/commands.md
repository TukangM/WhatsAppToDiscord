# Commands
You can use the following commands only in `#control-room` created by the bot. Note that all the commands are case-insensitive. So, `list`, `LIST`, and `lIsT` would evaluate the same way.

## start
Starts a new conversation. It can be used with a name or a phone number. 
- Format: `start <number with country code or name>`
- Examples:
    - `start 11231231234`: This would start a conversation with +1 123 123 1234.
    - `start John Doe`: This would start a conversation with John Doe. It has to be in your contacts.

## list
Lists your contacts and groups. 
- Format: `list <optional chat name to search>`
- Examples:
    - `list`: This would list all of your contacts and groups.
    - `list John`: This would list all of your contacts and groups that contain "John" in their name.

## listWhitelist
Shows all the whitelisted conversations. If no channel is whitelisted, the whitelist is disabled, meaning every message will be sent to Discord.
- Format: `listWhitelist`

## addToWhitelist
Adds the given channel to the whitelist.
- Format: `addToWhitelist #<channel name>`
- Examples:
    - `addToWhitelist #john-doe`: This would add John Doe to the whitelist, allowing them to send you a message if you have whitelist enabled.

## removeFromWhitelist
Removes the given channel from the whitelist.
- Format: `removeFromWhitelist #<channel name>`
- Examples:
    - `removeFromWhitelist #john-doe`: This would remove John Doe from the whitelist, preventing them to send you a message if you have whitelist enabled.
